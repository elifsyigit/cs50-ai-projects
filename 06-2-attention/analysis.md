# Analysis

## Layer 7, Head 4

In the attention visualizations, I observed that verbs consistently attend to their direct objects when predicting the masked tokens.

Example Sentences:
- Mom prepared the [MASK] before the guests arrived.
- The student solved the [MASK] before sunrise.

## Layer 6, Head 7

In the attention visualizations, I observed that verbs like tell and ask attend strongly to the “to-infinitive” part of the construction.

Example Sentences:
- [MASK] would like to sit down and make up. 
- I will go out [MASK] she tells me to.
