First, I asked ChatGPT to help me review:
-different numbers of convolutional and pooling layers
-different numbers and sizes of filters for convolutional layers
-different pool sizes for pooling layers
-different numbers and sizes of hidden layers
-dropout
and their advantages and usage, since I had forgotten some of the details.

Decided to keep things light, considering my laptop’s modest power.

Chose not to use too many hidden layers.
Also decided to go easy on dropout.

I looked up what parameters to use for:
-model.add(tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation="relu", input_shape=(30, 30, 3)))
-model.add(tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation="relu"))
-model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation="relu"))

In the end, I asked ChatGPT to review my code. With a helpful reminder, I added model.compile.

After running the code, the results were:
    Accuracy: 0.9834 – Loss: 0.0048

I was satisfied with this final result, so I didn’t make any further changes.
