# CS50 AI Projects - Work in Progress

This repository contains my solutions and ongoing progress for the projects in Harvard's CS50 AI course. I'm still working through the course, so some solutions might be incomplete or need further refinement. The projects are listed in the order of the course lectures, and I have implemented the solutions using the official course materials as a base.

## Notes

* I'm using Python 3.10 and working in VS Code.
* All projects are implemented based on the official CS50 AI course materials and lecture order.
* If you see any room for improvement or have suggestions, feel free to reach out!
