# CS50 AI Projects - Work in Progress

This repository contains my solutions and ongoing progress for the projects in Harvard's CS50 AI course. I'm still working through the course, so some solutions might be incomplete or need further refinement. The projects are listed in the order of the course lectures, and I have implemented the solutions using the official course materials as a base.

# Projects Completed ✅

## 00-1-degrees (Graph Search)
Implemented breadth-first and depth-first search to find the shortest path between people in a network.

## 00-2-tictactoe (Game AI) 🎮
Built a Minimax-based AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.

## 01-1-knights (Search Algorithms) 🏰
Solved the Knight’s Tour problem using A* search with heuristics to optimize pathfinding.

## 01-2-minesweeper (Constraint Satisfaction Problems) 📝
Developed an AI agent using constraint satisfaction and logical inference to solve the Minesweeper puzzle.

## 02-1-pagerank (PageRank Algorithm) 🌐
Implemented and tested the PageRank algorithm to model webpage importance.

## 02-2-heredity (Bayesian Networks) 💡
Created a Bayesian Network model to infer genetic traits using probability and inference methods.

## 03-1-crossword (Constraint Satisfaction Problems) 📝
Built a crossword puzzle generator and solver using backtracking and CSP techniques.

## 04-1-shopping (Machine Learning) 🛒
Trained and fine-tuned a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of purchases.

## 04-2-nim (Game Theory) 🕹️
Implemented a Minimax AI with alpha-beta pruning to play Nim optimally.

## 05-1-traffic (Convolutional Neural Networks) 🚗
Built and trained a CNN to classify traffic signs with high accuracy.
