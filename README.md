# CS50 AI Projects

This repository contains my solutions for all the projects in Harvard's CS50 AI course. I have successfully completed all the projects, implementing the solutions using the official course materials as a base.

## Completed Projects

* **00-1-degrees (Graph Search)**
    * Implemented breadth-first and depth-first search to find the shortest path between people in a network.
* **00-2-tictactoe (Game AI)**
    * Created an AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe optimally using the **Minimax** algorithm.
* **01-1-knights (Search Algorithms)**
    * Solved the Knight's Tour problem using **A* search** with heuristics to optimize pathfinding.
* **01-2-minesweeper (Constraint Satisfaction Problems)**
    * Developed a solver for the Minesweeper puzzle using **backtracking algorithms** and **constraint satisfaction methods**.
* **02-1-pagerank (PageRank Algorithm)**
    * Successfully implemented and tested the **PageRank algorithm**.
* **02-2-heredity (Bayesian Networks)**
    * Implemented **Bayesian Networks** and inference methods for genetic traits.
* **03-1-crossword (Constraint Satisfaction Problems)**
    * Solved the crossword puzzle using **backtracking algorithms** and **constraint satisfaction methods**.
* **04-1-shopping (Machine Learning)**
    * Created and fine-tuned a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of online purchases.
* **04-2-nim (Game Theory)**
    * Developed an AI agent using **Minimax** and **alpha-beta pruning** to play the game of Nim optimally.

## Notes
* All projects were completed in **Python 3.10** using **VS Code**.
* Implementations follow the **official CS50 AI course materials and lecture order**.
* Open to suggestions for improvements or alternative approaches!
