# CS50 AI Projects - Work in Progress

This repository contains my solutions and ongoing progress for the projects in Harvard's CS50 AI course. I'm still working through the course, so some solutions might be incomplete or need further refinement. The projects are listed in the order of the course lectures, and I have implemented the solutions using the official course materials as a base.

## Projects So Far

* **00-1-degrees (Graph Search)** ✅ Completed!
    * Implemented breadth-first and depth-first search for finding the shortest path between people in a network.
* **00-2-tictactoe (Game AI)** 🎮 Minimax AI working, refining strategy...
    * AI plays Tic-Tac-Toe optimally using Minimax. Currently refining the evaluation function to handle edge cases.
* **01-1-knights (Search Algorithms)** 🏰 Exploring A* and heuristics...
    * Working on solving the Knight's Tour problem using A* search with heuristics to optimize pathfinding.
* **01-2-minesweeper (Constraint Satisfaction Problems)** 📝 Researching strategies...
    * Exploring backtracking algorithms and constraint satisfaction methods for solving the Minesweeper puzzle.
* **02-1-pagerank (PageRank Algorithm)** 🌐 Implementing PageRank...
    * Working on implementing and testing the PageRank algorithm.
* **02-2-heredity (Bayesian Networks)** 💡 Researching Bayesian Networks...
    * Delving into Bayesian Networks and implementing inference methods for genetic traits.
* **03-1-crossword (Constraint Satisfaction Problems)** 📝 Researching strategies...
    * Exploring backtracking algorithms and constraint satisfaction methods for solving the crossword puzzle.
* **04-1-shopping (Machine Learning)** ⚠️ Still debugging...
    * Working on fine-tuning my machine learning model to predict the likelihood of purchases.
* **04-2-nim (Game Theory)** 🕹️ Minimax AI implemented, testing...
    * Developed an AI agent using Minimax and alpha-beta pruning to play the game optimally.
* **05-1-traffic (Convolutional Neural Networks)** 🚗 Building a CNN...
    * Building and training a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs.

## Notes

* I'm using Python 3.10 and working in VS Code.
* All projects are implemented based on the official CS50 AI course materials and lecture order.
* If you see any room for improvement or have suggestions, feel free to reach out!
